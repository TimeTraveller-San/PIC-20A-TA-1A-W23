          WIDENING


          In JAVA, the following are regarded as "widening" conversions...

              byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double.


          This is totally reasonable for

              byte --> short --> int --> long

          since this corresponds to the set inclusions

              [-2^7, 2^7-1] --> [-2^15, 2^15-1] 
                            --> [-2^31, 2^31-1] --> [-2^63, 2^63-1]

          and so no information is lost during such conversions.


          It is also reasonable for

              float --> double

          because it corresponds to setting (11 - 8) + (52 - 23) == 32
          extra bits to have value 0; no information is lost (assuming strictfp).

          The following conversions can lose information.

              int  --> float
              long --> float
              long --> double

          However, they're still regarded as "widening" conversions.


          Widening conversions can occur implictly.

          NARROWING


          The following are regarded as "narrowing" conversions...

              byte <-- short <-- int <-- long <-- float <-- double.


          Almost all narrowing conversions must be made explicitly, writing

              (T) expression

          to convert an expression to have type T.

          float  --> long  performs truncation    (in sensible cases).
          long   --> int   performs modular arithmetic.
          int    --> short performs modular arithmetic.
          short  --> byte  performs modular arithmetic.

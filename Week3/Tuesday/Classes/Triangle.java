  Side note...

  If I was to give the Circle and Rectangle classes longer names,
  I'd call them UnpositionedCircle and UnpositionedRectangle
  because they are not positioned on the Cartesian plane.

  If I was to give the Triangle class below a longer name,
  I'd call it PositionedTriangle because it *is* positioned
  on the Cartesian plane.

  It'd be easy to write PositionedCircle:
  just specify the center as a Point2D.

  It'd be more complicated to write PositionedRectangle:
  you'd have to do some vector calculations to ensure
  four Point2Ds do actually create a rectangle.

  To write UnpositionedTriangle, you'd probably end up
  specifying two side lengths and an angle.

  For learning purposes, the main benefit of the Triangle class

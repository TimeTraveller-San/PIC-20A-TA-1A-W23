# Inheritance
- Constructor Chaining
    - Use `this` to invoke current class' constructor
    - Use `super` to invoke parent's constructor
    - Parent's constructor is called before child's.
    - For inheritence, constructor call must be the first statement in a child class' constructor
- `TestBench.java`
    - Observe the effect of public, private and protected data members
    - A little background about [hashcodes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html), they're pretty cool.
    - `equals` is difficult to deal with

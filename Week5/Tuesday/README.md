# Midterm

Here are the snippets that could be examined and how much to focus on each...

## VariablesOfPrimitiveType.java
 - knowing the digits of 2^31 - 1 (and other such numbers) is not necessary;
 - knowing that data types have limited range is necessary.
 - knowing the exact precision of doubles is not necessary;
 - knowing that doubles are not perfect and that issues can arise when using them is necessary.
 - knowing how to use binary and hexadecimal is not necessary.
 - being aware of the compilation errors that can occur is necessary.
 - being able to correctly predict the output of arithmetic calculations where overflow has occurred is not necessary.
 - knowing that overflow can occur is necessary.

## OverloadingStaticMethods.java, TypeTester.java
 - everything is need-to-know.

## ControlFlow.java, Collatz.java
 - all control flow used should be familiar.
 - I could ask you to write code yourself, but I usually try and keep that to a minimum on midterms since they're a time-crunch as it is.
   If I do, you should expect a short solution.

## Objects.java
 - the array of array example is not as important as the rest.
 - it is necessary to understand the rest of the snippet very thoroughly.
 - I can dream up questions on this stuff for days! It is frequently poorly understood.

## Strings.java
 - will not be examined.
 - just know you should use 'equals' to compare Strings.

## Conversions.java
 - you should know the difference between widening and narrowing conversions.
 - you should know what leads to compilation errors (attempting implicit narrowing).
 - you do not need to exactly why a line like 103 produces 'true';
   you should be aware that such strange things can occur.
 - you can certainly ignore the very final comment.

## Classes.java, Circle.java, Rectangle.java, Point2D.java, Triangle.java, Square.java, Account.java, Audio.java, VarArgs.java
 - you should know all relevant coding aspects of these examples;
   you do not need to know sneaky formulae for the area of Triangles.

## Packages and Inheritance
 - can wait until the final and you've had more practice.

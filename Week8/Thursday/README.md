# Timers
`TimerTest.java`
- Fire actionEvent(s) at certain intervals.
- We can listen to this even and do cool stuff!
- Timer timer = new Timer(100, printSomething);
- Here 100 is delay in milliseconds. Timer fires the actionEvent ever `delay` millisecond.
- `printSomething` is an eventListener.
- Combine timer and repaint to animate cool stuff!

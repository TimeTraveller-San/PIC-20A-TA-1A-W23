1. Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event
2. It occurs during the execution of a program


# Unchecked Throwables:
    - RuntimeExceptions and Errors;
    - one is allowed to throw them or call a method which throws them
      even if they're not caught or declared in a throws clause.

# Checked Throwables:
    - Exceptions which aren't RuntimeExceptions;
    - when they're thrown or a method which throws them is called,
      they must be caught or declared in a throws clause.

# Streams
- Transfer data “one-by-one” (also called on-line, lazy reading, etc..)
- Transfer to/from files, network, etc.
